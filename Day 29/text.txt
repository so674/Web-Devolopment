1.animation-name--Specifies which animation (by name) to apply to the element.
   You define the animation using @keyframes.
2.animation-duration--Sets how long the animation takes to complete one cycle.
3.animation-timing--function-Controls the speed curve of the animation — how the animation accelerates and decelerates.
(linear → constant speed
ease → slow start, fast middle, slow end
ease-in → slow start
ease-out → slow end
ease-in-out → slow start and end
cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2) → custom curve)
4.animation-delay--Sets how long to wait before the animation starts.
5.animation-iteration-count--Defines how many times the animation should repeat.
(a number (1, 2, 3, …)
infinite → keeps looping forever)
